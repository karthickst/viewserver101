# viewserver101

basic example of how you can create an in-memory view server in Rust with RocksDB, allowing clients to create filtered custom views and receive real-time notifications for changes to the views. This example uses the tokio crate for async programming, rocksdb crate for interacting with RocksDB, and tokio-tungstenite crate for WebSocket support.


provides a basic structure for an in-memory view server with RocksDB and WebSocket support. However, it's just a starting point, and you'll need to add more functionality to make it production-ready.
Some potential next steps include:
Implementing data persistence and retrieval using RocksDB
Adding support for more advanced filtering and querying capabilities
Improving error handling and debugging
Adding security features, such as authentication and authorization
